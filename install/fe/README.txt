Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

We assume that if you have just installed the jflicks media system
server, then your next step should be to install the jflicks media system
desktop applications.  Even if you are building a server you will want to
run the "Aspirin" application on this installation directory.  The "Aspirin"
application will tell you what you may be missing on your system or
what problems you might have right away.  Best to solve these now!

So the next four steps are to:

1) Install the jflicks media system desktop apps.
2) Run Aspirin and solve all the problems it finds.
3) Start up this server by running the startup.sh or .bat file in this folder.
4) Run "Server Configuration".
