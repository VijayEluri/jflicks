Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

We wrote the Video Manager application because our experience using
other systems that did not supply a desktop application to manage a
video library was not a positive experience.

Other systems either:

1) Use the TV front end user interface to fetch metadata and fanart.
2) Have some "bulk" scripting updater.

Our experience was that using the TV interface was rather cumbersome,
plus you sometimes don't have a "choice" of fanart - you usually get
the "most popular".  And it's rather slow managing it at the TV.

The scripting solutions work well - but there are usually enough exceptions
to movie version or missing titles to make it not so automatic - you
tend to have to do a lot of managing anyway.

So our approach allows us:

1) To select the fanart we want.
2) Easily edit metadata about a movie or TV show.  Some descriptions are
just too verbose and describe the detail too much.
3) Manage our Home Video right along with the rest.  No way any other
project lets you manage Home Video as easily.

Even if you did not install the "system" Video Manager, you can use this
application to manage fanart for your recordings.
