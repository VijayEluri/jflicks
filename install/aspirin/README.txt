Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

You have just installed the Aspirin desktop application.  Using this
program you can examine any jflicks media system server or TV front end
installation.  The Aspirin program examines the bundles you have installed
and allows you to execute plugins that determine if the installation is
ready to run.  To make sure you have the proper installed system programs
and if there are any missing configuration files.

Aspirin just tries to solve problems to make running a HTPC easier.

If you have installed a jflicks media system server, and after you have
solved any issues that Aspirin flags, next install the Server Configuration
application to customize settings for your needs.
