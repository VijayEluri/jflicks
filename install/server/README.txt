Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

We assume that if you have just installed the jflicks media system
server, then your next step should be to install the jflicks media system
desktop applications.  Your next stop should be to install the "Aspirin"
application.  Using that you can examine the server installation you just
finished.  Try to solve any issues that Aspirin presents to you.  Things
will go smoother if you do so.

So the next steps are to:

1) Install the jflicks media system Aspirin application.
2) Run Aspirin and solve all the problems it finds in this installation.
3) Start up this server by running the startup.sh or .bat file in this folder.
