Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

After you have gotten a jflicks media system server up and running,
properly configured, the Scheduler desktop application is handy to
use to schedule recordings, make or edit recording rules, see what
is "upcoming" to record; or recordings that won't happen and the
reason why.  The Scheduler application can do some searching which
makes finding shows a little bit easier that using the TV front end.

Since the Scheduler app can run on any machine on your network, sometimes
it's more convenient to run especially if someone in your household
is watch something.  This way you can schedule things without
disturbing their TV watching.
