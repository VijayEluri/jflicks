Thanks for trying out the jflicks media system family of software
applications.

After you have installed a jflicks media system server, and ironed out
any issues by using the Aspirin application, it's time to make sure that
your server is running.  Go to your installation directory and in a
terminal run the startup.[sh,bat] script.

Next run this Server Configuration application and customize.  If you
have installed DVR functionality with some Recorder services, you no
doubt need to do a few things like linking a Schedules Direct lineup
with a Recorder.  And after that do a channel scan if necessary.  Not
all Recorders need a scan, but you need to check.

Once you have your services configured, we suggest installing the TV
front end or the desktop application Scheduler.  Using either of those
you could schedule some test recordings or watch live TV (if installed).

If you chose to install a Video Manager service you might need to install
the Video Manager desktop application.  It matches the "system" Video Manager
as that application allows you to manage metadata and fanart for your
video library.

One thing to remember - the Server Configuration, Scheduler, and Video
Manager desktop applications can be installed and run from any computer
on your network.  They interact with your jflicks media system server
via the network and can be on different machines.  The Aspirin application
is tied a server machine as it needs to check the current machine to do
it's job.
