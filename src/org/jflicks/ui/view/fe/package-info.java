/**
 * The fe view package is designed to be the UI for use at the TV.  Hence
 * it is different than the other clients which are meant to be run from
 * a PC on the local network.  The idea here is to be dynamic as possible
 * and build a UI that works well on a TV.  And the UI is most concerned
 * with playing media while the other desktop UI programs concern
 * configuration.
